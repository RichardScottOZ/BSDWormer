The fundamental worming algorithm is described fully in [Hornby et al., 1999]
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-246x.1999.00788.x).

Here, we present a brief summary of the highlights.

First and foremost, this is a _processing_ algorithm (in the spirit of Jon Claerbout's "processing vs. inversion" dichotomy). The inversion is _induced_ by a physical interpretation of the algorithm [Hornby et al, 2002] (http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGS02/05568/EGS02-A-05568.pdf) recognized after the initial theory paper.

Briefly, horizontal gradients of the Green's function of the Poisson equation -- when upward continued and amplitude corrected appropriately -- form both the analysing and synthesizing functions of a continuous wavelet transform of any function derived from Poisson's equation ("potential fields"). In geophysics, gravity and magnetic fields (the latter suitably operated on in the usual fashion found in textbooks) are prominent examples of such fields.
