Gravity Anomaly Grid  2009 Edition.

June 2009.

The 2009 edition of the gravity grid of Australia and surrounding areas is a compilation of over 1.4 Million onshore gravity stations and
offshore Marine Gravity data derived from Satellite Altimetry with a cell size of 800 m for the Lambert Conic Conformal Projection grids and
0.00833333 degrees for the geodetic grids. The onshore component uses Bouguer gravity anomalies and the offshore data are free air gravity anomalies.

The grids with data type IEEE4ByteReal are called:

	onshore_Bouguer_offshore_Freeair_gravity_Lambert_June_2009.ers for the Lambert Conic Conformal Projection grid and

	onshore_Bouguer_offshore_Freeair_gravity_geodetic_June_2009.ers for the geodetic grid. 

There are also two grids (a Lambert Conic Conformal Projection and a geodetic grid) which only cover Continental Australia. There is no offshore area 
included in the grids.

These are called:

	onshore_geodetic_Spherical_Cap_Bouguer_June_2009.ers and

	onshore_lambert_Spherical_Cap_Bouguer_June_2009.ers


An enhanced colour image (a 3-band Unsigned8BitInteger byte file) of the 2008 combined onshore and offshore gravity grid, using the pseudocolour look-up table
and a north-east gradient, is called:

	gravity_bandpass.bil

This image shows the Bouguer gravity anomalies onshore and free-air gravity anomalies offshore after applying a high-pass filter with a cut-off wavelength 
of 500 kilometres cut-off wavelength to the original grid.


A similar image of the unfiltered grid is called

	gravity_unfiltered.bil


Please Note: These grids and images may be used internally in Geoscience Australia for research/interpretation purposes, but should not be distributed
outside the Organisation.

External clients can access the grids using GADDS the on-line data facility.
